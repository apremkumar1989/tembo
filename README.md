# tembo
My implementation of a simple http server in java

###What does `Tembo` mean?
The meaning of the name is elephant. I chose this name because web server usually means handling a lot of requests and the fact that **Elephant** is known for **Power**.

###Why was this project created?
I just wanted to implement my own server. I wanted to experiment by building my own version.

Few reasons:
* Parse and construct Http messages. Boundaries of the Http request.
* How to dispatch delegate requests to various components
* How to handle error scenarios

###What frameworks are used in the application?
I want to develop without using any application frameworks(eg. spring etc) except for Logging, Mocks etc etc. so that I can understand the complexity to build everything from scratch. Also this allows me to think of applying various **Design Patterns** wherever applicable and learn.

###What frameworks/library dependencies are there?
* Maven
* SLF4J and Log4j2 for logging
